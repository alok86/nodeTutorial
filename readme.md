**25/64 Asynchronus javascript**
javascript is synchronous , blocking
single-threaded language
**1.synchronous**
if we have two function which log messages to the console , code execute top down , with only
one line executing at any given time
**2.Blocking**
No matter how long a previous process takes , the subsequent processes won't kick off until the former is completed
**3.single-threaded**
A thread is simply a process that your javascript
program can use to run a task

_we want non-blocking asynchronus behaviour which is made possible by a browser for FE and Node.js for backend_
